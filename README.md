The game was developed using Unity, leveraging the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for enhanced graphics and performance. Custom shaders and visual effects were created with Shader Graph. Cinemachine was employed for advanced camera control and effects. SpriteRenderer, TrailRenderer, and ParticleSystem were utilized for managing and rendering 2D sprites, dynamic visual effects, and particle effects, respectively. TextMeshPro (TMP) was used for high-quality UI text. All sprites and character animations were custom-created by the developer, and coroutines were used to manage game events, timings, and asynchronous operations.
